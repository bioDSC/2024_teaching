    "##### Note about `max(str1, str2)` from ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max` function in Python, when applied to strings, compares them lexicographically (i.e., in dictionary order). Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lexicographical Comparison**: The strings are compared character by character based on their Unicode values.\n",
    "2. **Character Comparison**: The comparison starts with the first character of each string. If the first characters are the same, it moves to the next character, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of `max(\"abc\", \"defgh\")`:\n",
    "- The first characters of the strings \"abc\" and \"defgh\" are 'a' and 'd', respectively.\n",
    "- The Unicode value of 'a' is 97, and the Unicode value of 'd' is 100.\n",
    "- Since 100 > 97, \"defgh\" is considered greater than \"abc\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `max(\"abc\", \"defgh\")` returns \"defgh\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given solution: \"max and min return TypeErrors in this case because the correct number of parameters was not supplied. If it just returned None, the error would be much harder to trace as it would likely be stored into a variable and used later in the program, only to likely throw a runtime error.\"\n",
    "\n",
