# R vs. Rstudio
    # R: language + interpretation software
    # RStudio: software that makes interaction w/ R easier

# Why R
    # Excel/graphpad: Clicking; irreproducible
    # R: Point by point recipe
        # easier to repeat / fix mistakes
        # managing complex tasks
        # much pre-written code exists ("libraries"/"packages")
        # free, open source, cross-platform

# Setting up

# About RStudio
    # File editor ("source")
    # Console, R without the editor
    # Environment (top right)
    # 

# Getting started
    # File >> New project (show in new window)
        # Work on several projects
        # Keep things together that belong together
    # (Switch to slideshow show folder structures)
