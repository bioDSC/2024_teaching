# Very simple plotting in base R
# Useful, but not very advanced

plot(interviews_plotting$no_membrs, interviews_plotting$liv_count,
     main = "Base R Scatterplot",
     xlab = "Number of Household Members",
     ylab = "Number of Livestock Owned")

# !! SKIP this "lattice" !!
# Another example of a plotting system

library(lattice)

xyplot(liv_count ~ no_membrs | village, data = interviews_plotting,
       main = "Lattice Plot: Livestock Count by Household Members",
       xlab = "Number of Household Members",
       ylab = "Number of Livestock Owned")

###

# general template

# <DATA> %>%
#     ggplot(aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
#     <GEOM_FUNCTION>()


interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point()




###

# Assign plot to a variable
interviews_plot <- interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items))

# Draw the plot as a dot plot
plot1 <- interviews_plot +
            geom_point()
plot1

# Addition MW
# Allows you to choose something else easily
plot2 <- interviews_plot +
            geom_density_2d(bins=7)
plot2


###

# so we have
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point()

# plot not optimal
# but points are hidden

# we can change properties
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)


# perhaps "jitter"?
# (adds random displacement)
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter()


# MW: this is (almost) data manipulation

# so we want less displacement; use parameters of the geom_jitter function
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5,
                width = 0.2,
                height = 0.2)

# can also change color
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5,
                color = "blue",
                width = 0.2,
                height = 0.2)


# and also highlight villages
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = village), alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0.2)


# (still not really optimal --> later improvement)


# "note"
# they give an alternative option, which already looks a bit better
interviews_plotting %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
   geom_count()

    # addition MW
    # always keep in mind, we can use help function
    ?geom_count

# Exercise
# 
# Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of rooms by village with 
# the respondent_wall_type showing in different colours. Does this seem like a 
# good way to display the relationship between these variables? 
# What other kinds of plots might you use to show this type of data?


# <GO OVER SOLUTION TOGETHER>





# my solution
interviews_plotting %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms, color = respondent_wall_type)) +
   geom_point()

interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = rooms)) +
    geom_jitter(aes(color = respondent_wall_type),
      alpha = 0.5,
        width = 0.2,
        height = 0.2)

# addition MW (just for show!)
interviews_plotting %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
   geom_density_2d(bins=6)+
    facet_grid(cols = vars(village))

XXXX CONTINUE HERE XXXX


# Another convenient display is the boxplot
interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
    geom_boxplot()


interviews_plotting %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = respondent_wall_type, y = rooms)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5,
        color = "tomato",
        width = 0.2,
        height = 0.2)+
    theme_bw() # addition MW, don't forget to mention google!!

# Exercise
# 
# (A)
# Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. 
# For example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. 
# An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape 
# (of the density of points) is drawn.
# 
# Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see geom_violin().
# 
# 
# (B)
# So far, weâ€™ve looked at the distribution of room number within wall type. 
# Try making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within wall type.
# 
# Create a boxplot for liv_count for each wall type. Overlay the boxplot layer 
# on a jitter layer to show actual measurements.
# 
# 
# (C)
# Add colour to the data points on your boxplot according to whether the respondent 
# is a member of an irrigation association (memb_assoc).

# Exercise
# 
# With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either 
# improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph 
# of your own. Use the RStudio ggplot2 cheat sheet for inspiration. 
# 
# Here are some ideas:
# - See if you can make the bars white with black outline.
# - Try using a different colour palette (see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/).
# 
# Addition MW:
# Color blind friendly palette (see also link above, A colorblind-friendly palette):

# Take home points

# - The data set and coordinate system can be defined using the ggplot function.
# - Additional layers, including geoms, are added using the + operator.
# - Many types of plots --> use google/other resources to suit your needs (edit MW)
# - Faceting allows you to generate multiple plots based on a categorical variable.
